# Social Media Engagement Analysis

## Overview

The Social Media Engagement Analysis project is designed to explore and analyze a simulated social media dataset to understand user engagement trends. This project focuses on analyzing likes across different categories to derive insights into how engagement varies by category and time.

## Project Structure

- **`social_media_engagement_analysis.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete analysis workflow, including data generation, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

- **`data/`**: Directory for storing data files used in the analysis (if applicable).
  - **`social_media_data.csv`**: Example of a data file (if applicable).

- **`notebooks/`**: Directory for additional notebooks or scripts (if applicable).
  - **`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`**: Additional notebook for exploratory data analysis (if applicable).

## Features

1. **Data Generation**: Creates a synthetic dataset with fields for date, category, and likes to simulate real-world social media data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame, performs initial exploration, and provides a summary of the dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Cleans the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and ensures correct data types for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, including:
   - **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of likes across all entries.
   - **Boxplot**: Compares likes across different categories to highlight variations and outliers.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Computes and displays average likes overall and by category to identify trends and insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and generating random data.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical plots and visualizations.
