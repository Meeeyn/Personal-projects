# My-personal-projects
Welcome to my data science projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of data science projects that highlight various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Each project demonstrates different techniques and methodologies used to extract insights from data.

**Repository Structure:**
This repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing a specific data science project. As I continue to work on new projects, they will be added to this repository. Each project directory includes its own README.md file with detailed information about the individual project.
